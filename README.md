- üèÜ **Scoring System**: 
  - Current score calculated as square root of seconds since last reset
  - High score tracking for motivation
- üö´ **Optional Privilege System**:
  - Define activities to restrict (like phone use or gaming)
  - Restrictions automatically adjust based on your score/high score ratio
- üé® **Dynamic Visual Feedback**: Color changes from red to green as you approach your high score

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Usage

1. **First Run**: The program will create an `info.txt` file to store your data

   - The timer will automatically start counting
   - Your score and high score will be displayed
   - The background color will change based on your progress
3. **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button when you complete the activity you're tracking
4. **Privileges**: Edit `info.txt` to add restrictions under "======Privileges======" section

### Customizing Privileges

2. Under "======Privileges======", add one restriction per line
3. Examples:
   ```

   ```
4. Save the file - restrictions will appear on next run

### Technical Details

- **Dependencies**: 
  - tkinter (included with Python)
