# LogWatch - A Productivity Timer Application

LogWatch is a Python-based productivity timer that helps you track time between specific activities (like logging into a system or completing tasks). It features a persistent timer, scoring system, and optional privilege restrictions to encourage discipline.

## Features

- üîÑ **Reset Button**: Manual reset with timestamp recording
- üìÖ **Automatic Logging**: Records exact dates and times of each reset
- üèÜ **Scoring System**: 
  - Current score calculated as square root of seconds since last reset
  - High score tracking for motivation
- üö´ **Optional Privilege System**:
  - Define activities to restrict (like phone use or gaming)
  - Restrictions automatically adjust based on your score/high score ratio
- üé® **Dynamic Visual Feedback**: Color changes from red to green as you approach your high score

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.11.6 or later installed
2. Clone this repository or download the script
3. Run the script directly:
